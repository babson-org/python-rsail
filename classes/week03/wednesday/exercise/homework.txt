and or run tictactoe.py in labs/lab2/student_code to see how the game plays -> but come 
up with two questions/

for instance, take a look at play_game.py.  One person could ask why is this line in the code:
sys.stdout.flush()  we haven't seen that before but what do you think it does?

Also, please prepare three questions you have on Python Notes Part 1 or Part 2 (pdfs)
