For Monday complete _update_postion.py and buy_input.py.

When a purchase is made our cash position will need to be adjusted 
this should happen in the _update_postions() function
Is the cash adjustment a transaction? Does it need to be added to 
the transactions list?

Place all error checking logic for a BUY transaction inside of buy_input.py
valid tickers for purchase are in the file ticker.data
For now, ask user for ticker, shares and transaction price
make sure the portfolio has enough cash on hand for the purchase

Do not try to run your code!  Make a good faith effort, you may work in groups
of 3 or less. Spend 1 1/2 to 3 hours on this.
