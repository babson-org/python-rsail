Prepare with your solutions for ai_move.py and calc_score.py from Lab 2 (Tic-Tac-Toe).

Both functions are pretty straightforward. You may use the starter code in calc_score.py, but it’s not required. 
Implement calc_score so it checks the 8 winning lines (3 rows, 3 columns, 2 diagonals) and:

returns 30 if the cells in a line sum to 30,
returns -30 if they sum to -30,
otherwise returns 0.

See you Monday — thanks!
